# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Bishir**, a software developer based in India.

I'm obsessed with pixel-perfect UI and building meaningful web applications.

If an idea sparks my interest, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is React, Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. I love crafting responsive, beautiful interfaces that users enjoy.

I've built multiple projects, and I'm always working on something new.
